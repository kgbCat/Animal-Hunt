- Encourages children to spend more time outdoors, in parks, in zoos, observing and studying animals.
- Expands their horizons and inspires to travel




### By capturing an animal on camera, the child will get it on the photo-trophy list and learn its name. 
### After that the child can draw it as he or she sees it. 


- Classification of photos is made by using the CoreML model (SqueezeNet). 
- Data is stored in Core Data for further display in the table. 
- Drawing images is implemented using the PencilKit library
